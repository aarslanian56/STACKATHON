My attempt to learn and use BOOTSTRAP css to learn a new way to style
Hopfully the new ways of inline styling via className and the numerous reactstrap components help our CAPSTONE

1) Started with a simple npx create-react-app
2) Then install dependencies, axios, bootstrap and reactstrap
3) Import Bootstrap CSS and Boostrap Bundle JS into root file
4) Now build components like normal, did NOT use a redux store since local useStates were sufficient for this example

5) Reactstrap is one of a couple ways to apply Bootstrap styling, in this methodology, we need to import JSX tags, like Button
6) UNLIKE CSS, here, you do your inline styling within the JSX
7) Also, new syntax means that className is where you typically add styling

TO DO:
-better understand the styling syntax within App.js, as well as 3 components
-better understand the new techniques and figure out how to apply to other react projects
